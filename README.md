## Hello, GitHub!
### Who is Mike Lierman?

I'm Mike, a **business owner and IT professional** with a passion persuing everyday challenges and learning beyond what I'm currently capable of. Which is how I landed here on GitHub - a drive and desire to learn DevOps, and explore the world of coding and programming that I learned as a kid. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and creations with the community to help others. On my GitHub, you will find random projects, trinkets, scripts, code, and hacks I've created throughout my daily life in tech. If ideas make their way into bigger projects, then they will eventually find a home at [Invise Labs](https://github.com/InviseLabs) - a venture I created to host my larger side projects and contributions - all of which are currently free.

Where it began: My ventures in coding never made their way into a job or carrer, I took an alternative path in technology, instead persuing a business in IT. But before that, at the age of 9, my brother-in-law gave me a copy of MSDN Visual Studio 2002, and this piqued my curiosity. This sparked my curious mind in the world of code, which never was satisified.

### My Businesses
* **@InviseSolutions [üîó](https://invisesolutions.com):** Founded over 15 years ago, Invise Solutions started as a computer repair business from a spare bedroom. Today, it's a full-fledged IT company offering services and solutions to local businesses in Utah County. I lead a talented team of technicians who you may occasionally see in action.
* **@InviseLabs [üîó](https://github.com/InviseLabs):** From a fly-by-night project to an actual business. Many of the programming projects I create, lead, and direct can be found here. Many scripts are on my personal profile, but if it ends up being a project, you'll find it at Invise Labs. From tools to programs that solve IT problems, Invise Labs is a testament to my passion for coding and continuous learning.
* **@LiermanCo [üîó](https://lierman.co):** Another venture where I explore new challenges and opportunities, driven by curiosity and a restless mind.

## My Journey
Passion and curiosity drive me to explore new challenges and opportunities. I have a restless mind that never stops learning, and I strive for excellence in everything I do. When I was 15, I launched Invise Solutions, a computer repair business, from a spare bedroom converted into an office. Since then, my work has become dynamic and diverse. Many may not recognize me as that teenager I was; I have grown up, and so has my business. Invise Solutions is now a full-fledged IT company that offers services to people and designs and implements IT solutions for local businesses in Utah County.

As someone who is not always doing the computer repairs or answering the phones anymore, this makes many wonder, ‚Äúwhat is Mike working on these days?‚Äù I am always learning new aspects within fields related to tech. Besides my computer/IT skills, coding and programming are also a passion and hobby of mine, which is why you may find me here on GitHub. Several years ago, I founded Invise Labs, a business that houses many of my coding and programming projects, such as tools and programs that solve problems and make life in IT easier.
