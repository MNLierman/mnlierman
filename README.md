## Hello, GitHub!
### Who is Mike Lierman?

I'm Mike, a business owner and IT professional with a passion for doing more with less. I love sharing my knowledge and creations with the community to help others. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects and contributions.

### My Businesses
* @InviseSolutions: Founded over 15 years ago, Invise Solutions started as a computer repair business from a spare bedroom. Today, it's a full-fledged IT company offering services and solutions to local businesses in Utah County. I lead a talented team of technicians who you may occasionally see in action.
* @InviseLabs: This is where I house all my coding and programming projects. From tools to programs that solve IT problems, Invise Labs is a testament to my passion for coding and continuous learning.
* @LiermanCo: Another venture where I explore new challenges and opportunities, driven by curiosity and a restless mind.

### My Skills
I have expertise in various programming languages and technologies. Here's just a few:

* Bash
* Scripting
* C#
* PHP
* JavaScript
* Java
* SysAdmin
* Servers
* IT and Networking
* Web Developement
* Scripting
* And much more...

### My Journey
Passion and curiosity drive me to explore new challenges and opportunities. I have a restless mind that never stops learning, and I strive for excellence in everything I do. When I was 15, I launched Invise Solutions, a computer repair business, from a spare bedroom converted into an office. Since then, my work has become dynamic and diverse. Many may not recognize me as that teenager I was; I have grown up, and so has my business. Invise Solutions is now a full-fledged IT company that offers services to people and designs and implements IT solutions for local businesses in Utah County.

As someone who is not always doing the computer repairs or answering the phones anymore, this makes many wonder, ‚Äúwhat is Mike working on these days?‚Äù I am always learning new aspects within fields related to tech. Besides my computer/IT skills, coding and programming are also a passion and hobby of mine, which is why you may find me here on GitHub. Several years ago, I founded Invise Labs, a business that houses many of my coding and programming projects, such as tools and programs that solve problems and make life in IT easier.
